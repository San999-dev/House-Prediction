# 🏡 House Price Prediction

## 📌 Overview
This project predicts the **price of houses** based on various features like the number of rooms, location, area, and other property details.  
Using machine learning regression models, the system helps estimate property prices for buyers, sellers, and real estate businesses.

## 🗂️ Dataset
The dataset typically includes:
- `Yearbuilt` – IN which year house built  
- `Floor Information` – How Mnay Foolr Huse have? 
- `YearBuilt` – Year the house was built  
- `TotalBathrooms` – Bathroom information  
- `YearSold` – Sold Year 


*(Update with the exact columns from your dataset if different)*

## ⚙️ Tech Stack
- Python 🐍  
- Pandas & NumPy (data preprocessing)  
- Matplotlib & Seaborn (data visualization)  
- Scikit-learn (Linear Regression, Random Forest, model evaluation)  

---

## 🚀 Workflow
1. Load and explore the dataset  
2. Handle missing values and encode categorical variables  
3. Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)  
4. Feature scaling and selection  
5. Train regression models (Linear Regression, Random Forest, etc.)  
6. Evaluate performance using R² Score, MAE, and RMSE  
7. Predict house prices for new input data  

---

## 📊 Results
- The trained model provides accurate predictions for house prices.  
- Feature importance analysis shows which factors (like living area or overall quality) influence price the most.
